Java Practice Programs (Up to Java 8)

This repository contains Java programs and exercises that I have practiced, covering core Java concepts up to Java 8. The programs include procedural programming, basic data structures, algorithms, and Java 8 features.

Topics / Folder Overview
Folder Name	Description
BasicPrpgrams	Basic programs covering variables, operators, input/output, loops, etc.
Arrays	Single and multi-dimensional array problems and operations
Collections	Java Collections Framework usage (List, Set, Map, etc.)
Collectors	Usage of Collectors in Java Streams
ExceptionHandling	Programs on try-catch, multiple exceptions, and custom exceptions
InnerClass	Examples of inner classes, static nested classes
Iterable	Programs using the Iterable interface
Java8	Java 8 features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional interfaces
Map	HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap examples
NumberLogics	Number-based logic problems (prime, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.)
Queue	Queue implementations and usage
RandomNumber	Programs generating and using random numbers
Recursion	Recursive algorithms and examples
Set	HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet examples
Stream / Streams	Stream API examples including filter, map, reduce
Threads	Basic multithreading and thread manipulation
How to Run

Make sure Java 8 or higher is installed.

Navigate to the folder of the program you want to run.

Compile the program:

javac ProgramName.java


Run the compiled program:

java ProgramName

Notes

Programs are mostly procedural, without advanced OOP concepts.

Java 8 features are included in Java8, Stream, and Collectors folders.

This repository is for learning and practice purposes to strengthen core Java concepts and logic-building skills.
